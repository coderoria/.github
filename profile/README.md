# üëã Hi there
We are CodeRoria, a duo from Germany that develops **software for creators**. Oftentimes, we are committed to assisting a single streamer on their journey and providing the tools to deliver the content they imagined.

# We ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source
Our software is custom designed for the individual content creator. That's why - until the software is in regular use, it will not be released. Most of the time, we are just not ready yet. If you know some of our software from creators and it's not listed here, keep an eye out! **It will be there at some point.**
