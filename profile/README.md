# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
We are CodeRoria, a dev-duo from Germany, that develops **software for creators**. Oftentimes, we are committed to assist a single streamer on their journey and provide the tools to deliver the content they imagined, but we also work on projects that are made for streaming in general. 

# ðŸŒŽ Releasing our Software
Most of our software is made to fit the needs of an individual creator. That's why - if the software isn't intended to be used by everyone - it probably won't be released.
