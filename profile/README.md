# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
We are CodeRoria, a duo from Germany that develops **software for creators**. Oftentimes, we are committed to assist a single streamer on their journey and provide the tools to deliver the content they imagined.

# ðŸŒŽ Releasing our Software
Out software is made for the individual creator. That's why - if the software isn't intended to be used by everyone - it probably won't be released.
